        "These examples give a basic introduction to the idea of classes in Python and to object-orientated programming (OOP). They offer a good solution for generating objects (people, modules, products, game characters, etc.) in software that can share properties and methods. OOP is easily the most common programming paradigm in use today (although perhaps not quite as unequivically as it was in the past). However, it is very easy for classes and inheritance to get completely out of control and confusing to everyone involved, and the real art is to ensure careful planning and design of the class hiearachy. As with all programming it is a powerful tool ... but must be used correctly and in a thoughtful fashion."
